            <p>I consider myself a Jack of many trades. I've held a number of different positions over the years, and Each one has helped shape me into a well-rounded developer with a unique & broad skillset. More than making stunning web content and software applications, I enjoy working with people. I believe wholeheartedly that coding is a team sport. Nothing great can be done alone, and a healthy relationship with my teammates is a vital prerequisite for success.</p>
